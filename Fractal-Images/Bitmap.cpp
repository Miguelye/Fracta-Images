	/// be written in the file:
	/// 
	/// ios::out: this mean that we intent to open the file for writing.
	///		It means you will be able to write data to the file, and if the
	///		file already exists, it will be truncated (its content will be deleted)
	///		before you start writing. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
	/// 
	/// ios::binary:  This flag specifies that you want to open the file in binary mode.
	///		In binary mode, data is treated as a sequence of bytes, and there is no automatic
	///		translation of line-ending characters. Binary mode is often used when working with non-text files,
	///		such as binary data or images.
